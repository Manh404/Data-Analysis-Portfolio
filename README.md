# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
In this section I will use data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
## PROJECT 1 ( Airline)

[PROJECT-AIRLINE](https://github.com/Manh404/Project-Airline)


## Goal:

to conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the dataset to gaininsights into passenger demographics, travel patterns, and peak travel times.

## Description: 

Our dataset comprises nearly 100,000 records of flight information, including details about passengers, their demographics, travel patterns, and arrival dates.

## Skills:
data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

## Technology: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotliby.

The project also use Hypothesis testing to Compare travel patterns between genders or age groups: Test for differences in the proportion of cancelled flights between countries using chi-squares test


## Project Customer Movie behavior

[ProjectCustomer](https://github.com/Manh404/Project-Customer)



This project involves end-to-end data analysis on a real-world dataset including customer profiles, ticket purchase history, device usage, campaign details, and status logs. The data is cleaned, merged, and visualized to uncover patterns in ticket purchases, customer demographics, and campaign performance. The notebook generates actionable insights into which customer segments respond to promotions and how behavior varies over time.

## Skills : 

Applied Data Cleaning and Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),Data VisualizationFeature ,EngineeringPivot ,Tables and Time Series Analysis,Insight Communication and Dashboarding

## Technology Used 

Python ,Pandas (data manipulation),NumPy (numerical operations),Matplotlib (visualization)

## Results 
Built a consolidated dataset of customer, campaign, and transaction data,Identified that promotional campaigns significantly increased ticket purchases.,Found seasonal trends and demographic patterns (e.g., age, region),Delivered clear visualizations that support marketing decision-making
